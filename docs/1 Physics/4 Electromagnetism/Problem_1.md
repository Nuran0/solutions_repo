# Formulas Related to Lorentz Force and Applications

## 1. Lorentz Force Equation

The Lorentz force equation describes the force experienced by a charged particle moving in an electric and magnetic field.

$$
\mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})
$$

Where:
- $q$ is the charge of the particle,
- $\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field,
- $\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field,
- $\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity of the particle.

## 2. Velocity of a Charged Particle in a Uniform Magnetic Field

When a charged particle moves perpendicular to a magnetic field, it undergoes circular motion. The radius of the circular path is given by:

$$
r = \frac{mv}{qB}
$$

Where:
- $m$ is the mass of the particle,
- $v$ is the velocity of the particle,
- $q$ is the charge of the particle,
- $B$ is the magnetic field strength.

## 3. Cyclotron Frequency (Angular Frequency)

In a cyclotron, charged particles move in a circular trajectory due to the magnetic field. The angular frequency of this motion is given by:

$$
\omega = \frac{qB}{m}
$$

Where:
- $\omega$ is the angular frequency (in radians per second),
- $q$ is the charge of the particle,
- $B$ is the magnetic field strength,
- $m$ is the mass of the particle.

The frequency of the circular motion (in Hz) is:

$$
f = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} = \frac{qB}{2\pi m}
$$

## 4. Mass Spectrometer Formula

In a mass spectrometer, the radius of the path taken by the charged particle in a magnetic field is used to determine its mass-to-charge ratio. The formula is:

$$
r = \frac{mv}{qB}
$$

Where:
- $r$ is the radius of the circular path,
- $m$ is the mass of the particle,
- $v$ is the velocity of the particle,
- $q$ is the charge of the particle,
- $B$ is the magnetic field strength.

By measuring $r$ and knowing $v$ and $B$, we can solve for the mass-to-charge ratio ($\frac{m}{q}$).

## 5. Force on a Moving Charge in a Uniform Electric Field

The force on a charged particle moving in an electric field is given by:

$$
\mathbf{F} = q\mathbf{E}
$$

Where:
- $\mathbf{F}$ is the force,
- $q$ is the charge of the particle,
- $\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field.

## 6. Kinetic Energy of a Particle Accelerated by an Electric Field

If a charged particle is accelerated by an electric field, the kinetic energy gained is given by:

$$
K.E. = qV
$$

Where:
- $K.E.$ is the kinetic energy,
- $q$ is the charge of the particle,
- $V$ is the potential difference the particle is accelerated through.

## 7. Motion of a Particle in Crossed Electric and Magnetic Fields

When both electric and magnetic fields are applied simultaneously, the particleâ€™s trajectory can be affected by both forces. The general form of the motion equation is:

$$
q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}) = m\frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt}
$$

This equation can be solved using numerical methods (like Euler's method or Runge-Kutta) to find the particle's trajectory over time.

## 8. Electric Force Due to a Uniform Field

For a uniformly distributed electric field, the electric force on a particle is:

$$
\mathbf{F}_E = q\mathbf{E}
$$

Where:
- $\mathbf{F}_E$ is the electric force,
- $q$ is the charge,
- $\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field.

## 9. Magnetic Force on a Charged Particle

The magnetic force on a moving charged particle is given by:

$$
\mathbf{F}_B = q(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})
$$

Where:
- $\mathbf{F}_B$ is the magnetic force,
- $\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity of the particle,
- $\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field.

## 10. Lorentz Force in Terms of Energy

The total energy of a charged particle in a magnetic field is a sum of its kinetic energy and the work done by electric fields:

$$
E_{\text{total}} = K.E. + \text{Work done by } \mathbf{E}
$$

Where the kinetic energy $K.E.$ is:

$$
K.E. = \frac{1}{2} mv^2
$$
