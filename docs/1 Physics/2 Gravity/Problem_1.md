# Problem 1
## Derivation of Kepler's Third Law for Circular Orbits

Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period ($T$) of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($r$) of its orbit. This relationship can be derived from Newton's law of gravitation.

### Step 1: Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

According to Newton's law of gravitation, the gravitational force $F$ between two masses, such as the Sun and a planet, is given by:

$$
F = \frac{G M m}{r^2}
$$

Where:
- $G$ is the gravitational constant,
- $M$ is the mass of the Sun,
- $m$ is the mass of the planet,
- $r$ is the distance between the two bodies.

### Step 2: Centripetal Force

For a planet to remain in a circular orbit around the Sun, the gravitational force must provide the centripetal force required for circular motion. The centripetal force $F_{c}$ for an object moving in a circle is given by:

$$
F_{c} = \frac{m v^2}{r}
$$

Where:
- $m$ is the mass of the planet,
- $v$ is the orbital velocity of the planet,
- $r$ is the orbital radius.

### Step 3: Equating the Forces

Since the gravitational force provides the centripetal force, we set these two forces equal to each other:

$$
\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \frac{m v^2}{r}
$$

Simplifying the equation:

$$
\frac{G M}{r^2} = \frac{v^2}{r}
$$

$$
v^2 = \frac{G M}{r}
$$

### Step 4: Orbital Velocity and Orbital Period

The orbital velocity $v$ of the planet can also be related to the orbital period $T$. The distance traveled in one orbit is the circumference of the orbit, which is $2 \pi r$. Therefore, the orbital velocity $v$ is given by:

$$
v = \frac{2 \pi r}{T}
$$

Substituting this expression for $v$ into the previous equation:

$$
\left(\frac{2 \pi r}{T}\right)^2 = \frac{G M}{r}
$$

Simplifying:

$$
\frac{4 \pi^2 r^2}{T^2} = \frac{G M}{r}
$$

### Step 5: Solving for the Orbital Period

Now, solve for the orbital period $T^2$:

$$
T^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2 r^3}{G M}
$$

### Conclusion

This equation shows that the square of the orbital period ($T^2$) is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius ($r^3$). The constant of proportionality is $\frac{4 \pi^2}{G M}$, where $M$ is the mass of the central body (such as the Sun) and $G$ is the gravitational constant. Therefore, we have:

$$
T^2 \propto r^3
$$

This is Kepler's Third Law, which applies to circular orbits.
