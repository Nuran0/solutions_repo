## Cosmic Velocities: Definition and Physical Meaning

Cosmic velocities refer to the different speeds that are necessary for an object to perform specific actions in relation to a celestial body, such as a planet or star. These velocities—first, second, and third cosmic velocities—are essential concepts in understanding how objects move within gravitational fields, and they play a crucial role in space exploration.

### 1. **First Cosmic Velocity (Orbital Velocity)**

The first cosmic velocity is the velocity an object must have to enter a stable circular orbit around a celestial body. This is the minimum speed required to keep an object moving in orbit, counteracting the force of gravity pulling it towards the center of the celestial body.

#### Formula:
The formula for the first cosmic velocity $v_1$ is given by:

$$
v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{G M}{r}}
$$

Where:
- $v_1$ is the first cosmic velocity (orbital velocity),
- $G$ is the gravitational constant ($6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2}$),
- $M$ is the mass of the celestial body (e.g., the Earth or the Sun),
- $r$ is the distance from the center of the celestial body to the object (orbital radius).

#### Physical Meaning:
The first cosmic velocity is the velocity at which an object must travel to remain in orbit around a planet or other celestial body without falling back to the surface or escaping into space. For Earth, this velocity is approximately **7.8 km/s** at the surface. This is the speed a satellite must achieve to stay in low Earth orbit (LEO).

### 2. **Second Cosmic Velocity (Escape Velocity)**

The second cosmic velocity is the speed at which an object must travel in order to escape the gravitational influence of a celestial body, without any further propulsion. This velocity ensures that the object can overcome the gravitational pull of the body and travel away from it indefinitely.

#### Formula:
The formula for the second cosmic velocity $v_2$ (escape velocity) is given by:

$$
v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2 G M}{r}}
$$

Where:
- $v_2$ is the second cosmic velocity (escape velocity),
- $G$ is the gravitational constant,
- $M$ is the mass of the celestial body,
- $r$ is the distance from the center of the celestial body to the object (similar to the orbital radius).

#### Physical Meaning:
The second cosmic velocity is the speed required for an object to escape a celestial body's gravitational field without the need for additional propulsion. If an object achieves this velocity, it will continue to move away from the celestial body and will not return, even though it is still under the influence of gravity. For Earth, this velocity is approximately **11.2 km/s**.

### 3. **Third Cosmic Velocity (Escape from the Solar System)**

The third cosmic velocity is the velocity required for an object to escape the gravitational influence of the entire star system (such as the Solar System). This velocity enables the object to leave the Sun’s gravitational pull and enter interstellar space.

#### Formula:
The formula for the third cosmic velocity $v_3$ is given by:

$$
v_3 = \sqrt{\frac{3 G M_{\text{sun}}}{r_{\text{Earth}}}}
$$

Where:
- $v_3$ is the third cosmic velocity (velocity to escape the Solar System),
- $M_{\text{sun}}$ is the mass of the Sun,
- $r_{\text{Earth}}$ is the distance from the Earth to the Sun (approximately 1 AU).

#### Physical Meaning:
The third cosmic velocity is the speed needed for an object to break free from the gravitational pull of the Sun and leave the Solar System. This
