Fundamental Principles We begin with Newton\u2019s Second Law of Motion applied to two-dimensional projectile motion under gravity: The only force acting on the object (ignoring air resistance) is gravity. Acceleration due to gravity is constant and acts downward with magnitude \\(g\\) . Let the object be projected with an initial velocity \\(v_0\\) at an angle \\(\\theta\\) to the horizontal. Equations of Motion We split the motion into horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components. Horizontal acceleration: \\(a_x = 0\\) Vertical acceleration: \\(a_y = -g\\) Initial velocity components: - \\(v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos(\\theta)\\) - \\(v_{0y} = v_0 \\sin(\\theta)\\) Using basic kinematic equations: Horizontal Motion: \\[ x(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t \\] Vertical Motion: \\[ y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] Time of Flight The projectile returns to the same vertical level when \\(y(t) = 0\\) (assuming it lands at the same height it was launched): \\[ 0 = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] Factor out \\(t\\) : $$ t \\left( v_0 \\sin(\\theta) - \\frac{1}{2} g t \\right) = 0 $$ Ignoring the trivial solution \\(t = 0\\) , we get: $$ t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} $$ Range of the Projectile To find the horizontal range \\(R\\) , substitute the total time of flight into \\(x(t)\\) : \\[ R = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Using the identity \\(\\sin(2\\theta) = 2 \\sin(\\theta) \\cos(\\theta)\\) : \\[ R(\\theta) = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] Family of Solutions The above equation defines a family of parabolic trajectories , each determined by a specific launch angle \\(\\theta\\) and initial velocity \\(v_0\\) .
