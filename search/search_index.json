Fundamental Principles We begin with Newton\u2019s Second Law of Motion applied to two-dimensional projectile motion under gravity: The only force acting on the object (ignoring air resistance) is gravity. Acceleration due to gravity is constant and acts downward with magnitude \\(g\\) . Let the object be projected with an initial velocity \\(v_0\\) at an angle \\(\\theta\\) to the horizontal. Equations of Motion We split the motion into horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components. Horizontal acceleration: \\(a_x = 0\\) Vertical acceleration: \\(a_y = -g\\) Initial velocity components: - \\(v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos(\\theta)\\) - \\(v_{0y} = v_0 \\sin(\\theta)\\) Using basic kinematic equations: Horizontal Motion: \\[ x(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t \\] Vertical Motion: \\[ y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] Time of Flight The projectile returns to the same vertical level when \\(y(t) = 0\\) (assuming it lands at the same height it was launched): \\[ 0 = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] Factor out \\(t\\) : $$ t \\left( v_0 \\sin(\\theta) - \\frac{1}{2} g t \\right) = 0 $$ Ignoring the trivial solution \\(t = 0\\) , we get: $$ t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} $$ Range of the Projectile To find the horizontal range \\(R\\) , substitute the total time of flight into \\(x(t)\\) : \\[ R = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Using the identity \\(\\sin(2\\theta) = 2 \\sin(\\theta) \\cos(\\theta)\\) : \\[ R(\\theta) = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] Family of Solutions The above equation defines a family of parabolic trajectories , each determined by a specific launch angle \\(\\theta\\) and initial velocity \\(v_0\\) . For a fixed \\(v_0\\) : As \\(\\theta\\) varies, so does the range \\(R(\\theta)\\) . Maximum range occurs at \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) , where \\(\\sin(2\\theta) = 1\\) . Pairs of angles \\((\\theta, 90^\\circ - \\theta)\\) give the same range due to the symmetry of the sine function. Summary of Governing Equations: Horizontal motion : \\(x(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t\\) Vertical motion : \\(y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2\\) Time of flight : \\(T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g}\\) Range : \\(R(\\theta) = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g}\\) Task 2: Analysis of the Range Objective: To investigate how the horizontal range of a projectile depends on the angle of projection and how variations in initial velocity ( \\(v_0\\) ) and gravitational acceleration ( \\(g\\) ) influence this relationship. Recap: Range Equation From Task 1, we derived the horizontal range of a projectile as: \\[ R(\\theta) = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] This formula clearly shows that the range: - Depends on \\(\\sin(2\\theta)\\) , which peaks at \\(2\\theta = 90^\\circ\\) \u2192 \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) . - Is directly proportional to the square of the initial velocity \\(v_0\\) . - Is inversely proportional to gravitational acceleration \\(g\\) . Task 3: Practical Applications Objective: To explore how the ideal projectile motion model can be adapted for real-world situations , including uneven terrain and the presence of air resistance . Revisiting the Ideal Model The basic model we previously used assumed: - No air resistance. - Flat, level ground. - Constant gravitational acceleration. - Point-mass projectile. However, real-world conditions often violate these assumptions. To make our model more applicable, we need to introduce more complexity step by step. 1. Uneven Terrain Scenario: The projectile is launched from or lands on a hill, slope, or building. Launch and landing heights are different: \\(y_0 \\neq 0\\) . Modified Equation for Range: If the landing height is different, we must solve for the time \\(t\\) when \\(y(t) = y_{\\text{final}}\\) , then compute: \\[ R = x(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t \\] This requires solving the quadratic: \\[ y_{\\text{final}} = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 + y_0 \\] Which has the form: \\[ \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 - v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t + (y_0 - y_{\\text{final}}) = 0 \\] The physically meaningful root is then used to compute the range. 2. Air Resistance (Drag) Air resistance exerts a force opposite to the direction of motion. It depends on: Velocity magnitude ( \\(v\\) ) Cross-sectional area ( \\(A\\) ) Air density ( \\(\\rho\\) ) Drag coefficient ( \\(C_d\\) ) Drag Force: \\[ F_{\\text{drag}} = \\frac{1}{2} C_d \\rho A v^2 \\] This makes the motion nonlinear , requiring numerical solutions (e.g., with Euler or Runge-Kutta methods). Equations of Motion with Drag: Horizontal: $$ m \\frac{dv_x}{dt} = - \\frac{1}{2} C_d \\rho A v v_x $$ Vertical: $$ m \\frac{dv_y}{dt} = -mg - \\frac{1}{2} C_d \\rho A v v_y $$ Where \\(v = \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}\\) is the total speed. This system is typically solved using computational tools like Python's scipy.integrate.solve_ivp . Other Adaptations Wind: Introduces a horizontal acceleration or drift term. Can be modeled by adjusting \\(v_x\\) with wind speed or adding a force term. Rotating Earth (Coriolis Effect): Important in long-range artillery or missile trajectories . Causes slight horizontal deviation due to Earth's rotation. Varying Gravity: Gravity \\(g\\) decreases with altitude or varies on different planets. For high-altitude motion, \\(g\\) is a function of height: $$ g(h) = \\frac{G M}{(R + h)^2} $$ Insights Real-world motion is much more complex, but understanding the ideal case gives a solid foundation for building more advanced models. Engineers, physicists, and simulation experts often: Start with the basic model. Add one layer of complexity at a time. Use simulations and empirical data to refine the predictions. \u2705 Summary Factor Included in Ideal Model Included in Realistic Model Level Ground \u2705 \u274c (may vary) Air Resistance \u274c \u2705 Wind Effects \u274c \u2705 Varying Gravity \u274c \u2705 (e.g., for high altitudes) Uneven Terrain \u274c \u2705 Task 4: Implementation Objective: To implement a computational tool that simulates projectile motion and visualizes how the range varies with the angle of projection under different initial conditions . Core Formula Recap We use the ideal projectile range formula: \\[ R(\\theta) = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] This relationship allows us to: - Simulate range versus angle. - Vary \\(v_0\\) and \\(g\\) to study effects of different launch speeds and environments.
