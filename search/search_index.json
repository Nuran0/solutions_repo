Fundamental Principles We begin with Newton\u2019s Second Law of Motion applied to two-dimensional projectile motion under gravity: The only force acting on the object (ignoring air resistance) is gravity. Acceleration due to gravity is constant and acts downward with magnitude \\(g\\) . Let the object be projected with an initial velocity \\(v_0\\) at an angle \\(\\theta\\) to the horizontal. Equations of Motion We split the motion into horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components. Horizontal acceleration: \\(a_x = 0\\) Vertical acceleration: \\(a_y = -g\\) Initial velocity components: - \\(v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos(\\theta)\\) - \\(v_{0y} = v_0 \\sin(\\theta)\\) Using basic kinematic equations: Horizontal Motion: \\[ x(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t \\] Vertical Motion: \\[ y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] Time of Flight The projectile returns to the same vertical level when \\(y(t) = 0\\) (assuming it lands at the same height it was launched): \\[ 0 = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] Factor out \\(t\\) : $$ t \\left( v_0 \\sin(\\theta) - \\frac{1}{2} g t \\right) = 0 $$ Ignoring the trivial solution \\(t = 0\\) , we get: $$ t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} $$ Range of the Projectile To find the horizontal range \\(R\\) , substitute the total time of flight into \\(x(t)\\) : \\[ R = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Using the identity \\(\\sin(2\\theta) = 2 \\sin(\\theta) \\cos(\\theta)\\) : \\[ R(\\theta) = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] Family of Solutions The above equation defines a family of parabolic trajectories , each determined by a specific launch angle \\(\\theta\\) and initial velocity \\(v_0\\) . For a fixed \\(v_0\\) : As \\(\\theta\\) varies, so does the range \\(R(\\theta)\\) . Maximum range occurs at \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) , where \\(\\sin(2\\theta) = 1\\) . Pairs of angles \\((\\theta, 90^\\circ - \\theta)\\) give the same range due to the symmetry of the sine function. Summary of Governing Equations: Horizontal motion : \\(x(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t\\) Vertical motion : \\(y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2\\) Time of flight : \\(T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g}\\) Range : \\(R(\\theta) = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g}\\) Task 2: Analysis of the Range Objective: To investigate how the horizontal range of a projectile depends on the angle of projection and how variations in initial velocity ( \\(v_0\\) ) and gravitational acceleration ( \\(g\\) ) influence this relationship. Recap: Range Equation From Task 1, we derived the horizontal range of a projectile as: \\[ R(\\theta) = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] This formula clearly shows that the range: - Depends on \\(\\sin(2\\theta)\\) , which peaks at \\(2\\theta = 90^\\circ\\) \u2192 \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) . - Is directly proportional to the square of the initial velocity \\(v_0\\) . - Is inversely proportional to gravitational acceleration \\(g\\) . Python Simulation Below is a Python script to visualize how the range varies with projection angle for different values of \\(v_0\\) and \\(g\\) . ```python import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt def compute_range(theta_deg, v0, g): theta_rad = np.radians(theta_deg) return (v0 ** 2) * np.sin(2 * theta_rad) / g angles = np.linspace(0, 90, 500) Parameters for comparison v0_values = [10, 20, 30] g_values = [9.8, 1.6, 24.8] # Earth, Moon, Jupiter plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) Plot for different initial velocities on Earth for v0 in v0_values: ranges = compute_range(angles, v0, 9.8) plt.plot(angles, ranges, label=f'v\u2080 = {v0} m/s (g = 9.8 m/s\u00b2)') plt.xlabel('Angle of Projection (degrees)') plt.ylabel('Range (meters)') plt.title('Range vs Angle for Different Initial Velocities (g = 9.8)') plt.legend() plt.grid(True) plt.show() Plot for different gravity environments (fixed v0) plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) v0_fixed = 20 for g in g_values: ranges = compute_range(angles, v0_fixed, g) plt.plot(angles, ranges, label=f'g = {g} m/s\u00b2') plt.xlabel('Angle of Projection (degrees)') plt.ylabel('Range (meters)') plt.title(f'Range vs Angle for Different Gravity (v\u2080 = {v0_fixed} m/s)') plt.legend() plt.grid(True) plt.show()","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#investigating-the-range-as-a-function-of-the-angle-of-projection","text":"","title":"Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#task-1-theoretical-foundation","text":"","title":"Task 1: Theoretical Foundation"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#objective","text":"To derive the governing equations of projectile motion from first principles and understand how variations in initial conditions lead to a family of solutions.","title":"Objective:"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#fundamental-principles","text":"We begin with Newton\u2019s Second Law of Motion applied to two-dimensional projectile motion under gravity: The only force acting on the object (ignoring air resistance) is gravity.
